Extension functions: These are the functions that helps us to extend the functionality
of the class without getting into the code of that class
i.e. you just have to call the function of the class.

Ex. 

fun Int.triple(): Int {
    return this * 3
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    var result = 10.triple()
    println(result)
}

In the above example, we have made one function triple(), which triples the value of an integer.
So, in the main function, we have used the extension function calling to tripple the value passed i.e. 10 in our case.
